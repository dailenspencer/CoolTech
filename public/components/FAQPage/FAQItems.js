		question: "What is CoolTech proprietary Memory Fiber Layer?",
		answer: "The “Memory Fiber Layer” combined with our other selected premium foam layers for the core of the mattress, give our mattress a better bounce effect and make it feel more like a traditional spring mattress. It is much easier to turn around and move around on our mattress than any other foam mattress. You just do not sink in, you sleep on top. (of the mattress I mean). Instead of using a foam material with limited airflow, we use a “Memory Fiber Layer”. This material has 5 to 10 times more air flow capabilityn than any foam which leads to a lot less Heat Retention. In our case, the airflow is the ability for the air to escape from the mattress and to be replaced by fresh air."
